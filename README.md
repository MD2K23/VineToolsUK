# VineToolsUK
Some additional userscript based styles to change the look and feel of Amazon Vine. Download a userscript manager such as TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey or ViolentMonkey and then click on the download links below.


## Hide Vine Items
The hideVineItems.user.js script creates a new toolbar on the Amazon Vine store, and icons on each product, that allow you to manage each product's visibility. You can hide them individually or all at once, choose, as well as create keyword/regex filters to either hide or highlight them. This is a fork of [VineTools](https://github.com/robartsd/VineTools) by robartsd

## Top & Bottom Nav Bar
The navBarTopBottom.user.js script clones the pagination nav bar that normally appears at the bottom of the page of products, and puts it at the top as well. It is not compatible with the "Pagination on Top" stylesheet by Thor.

## Hide Categories
The hideCategories.user.js script makes the categories column on the left completely hidden, for if you prefer a clean look to the page and do not use the categories. It is not compatible with the "Collapsed Categories", "Categories With Emojis" or "Striped Categories" stylesheets by Thor.

## RFY, AFA & AI Tabs on Search
The tabsonSearchPage.user.js script duplicates the RFY, AFA & AI tab bar that appears on Amazon Vine and displays it on the Search results page, where it is normally not present. This allows you to go back to one of the product categories more quickly.

## Spaced Product Tiles
The spacedProducttiles.user.js script adds a light border and spacing between each product tile to improve readability, especially when used in conjuction with the Small Items style.
